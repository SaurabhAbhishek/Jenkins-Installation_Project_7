Step 1 — Installing Jenkins
The version of Jenkins included with the default Ubuntu packages is often behind the latest available version from the project itself. To ensure you have the latest fixes and features, use the project-maintained packages to install Jenkins.
First, add the repository key to your system:

1. wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key |sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg

The gpg --dearmor command is used to convert the key into a format that apt recognizes.
Next, let’s append the Debian package repository address to the server’s sources.list:

2. sudo sh -c 'echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg] http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

The [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg] portion of the line ensures that apt will verify files in the repository using the GPG key that you just downloaded.
After both commands have been entered, run apt update so that apt will use the new repository.

3. sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins

Step 2 — Starting Jenkins

4. sudo systemctl start jenkins.service
5. sudo systemctl status jenkins

Step 3 — Opening the Firewall

6.sudo ufw allow 8080
7. sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
8.sudo ufw enable

Step 4 — Setting Up Jenkins

9. sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
10. Create First Admin User,Instance Configurtaion (Jenkins URL)
